    <p>Our solar system is a vast collection of celestial bodies that revolve around the Sun. It consists of a central star, the Sun, and several planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and other smaller objects.</p>
    <p>The Sun, at the center of our solar system, is a massive ball of hot gas that provides heat and light to all the planets. It is the largest object in our solar system, accounting for more than 99% of its mass.</p>
    <p>There are eight planets in our solar system, listed in order from the Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Each planet has unique characteristics, such as size, composition, and atmosphere.</p>
    <p>Moons, or natural satellites, orbit around most of the planets. Earth, for example, has one moon called the Moon. Jupiter, the largest planet, has 79 known moons, including Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system.</p>
    <p>Asteroids are rocky objects that orbit the Sun, primarily found in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Comets are icy bodies that originate from the outer regions of the solar system and have a distinctive glowing coma and tail when they approach the Sun.</p>
    <p>Studying our solar system provides valuable insights into the formation of planets, the existence of life, and the nature of the universe. Space missions and telescopic observations continue to expand our knowledge and understanding of the wonders of our solar system.</p>

    <img class="galaxy-image" src="milky_way.jpg" alt="Milky Way Galaxy">
    <p>The Milky Way galaxy is our home within the vastness of the cosmos. It is a majestic spiral galaxy, spanning an estimated 100,000 light-years in diameter. The galaxy is named after the hazy band of light that stretches across the night sky, resembling a stream of milk.</p>
    <p>Within the Milky Way, billions of stars, including our Sun, reside along with countless other celestial objects. The galaxy is composed of a complex interplay of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter.</p>
    <p>The Milky Way belongs to a larger galactic group known as the Local Group, which also contains other galaxies such as Andromeda and the Triangulum Galaxy. The Local Group itself is just one small part of the even larger structure called the Virgo Supercluster.</p>
    <p>Studying the Milky Way provides us with insights into the formation and evolution of galaxies, the birth and death of stars, and the structure of the universe. Through observations and explorations, we continue to unravel the mysteries of our cosmic abode.</p>
